    "The current project is a Text Classification problem, specifically Sentiment Analysis. The dataset we will be using is the Large Movie Review Dataset, which can be found at http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/. We will try to solve the sentiment analysis problem to classify movie reviews as either positive or negative. This will be a supervised text classification problem because both the training data and test data movie reviews contain labels for either positive sentiment or negative sentiment. "

In stemming, the common word endings such as \"-ing\", \"s\", \"-ed\", \"-de\" are removed from the smallest unit of the word. There may be some issues with words which have special conjugations, for example \"feel\" and \"felt\", since stemming just removes common word endings from the string.
